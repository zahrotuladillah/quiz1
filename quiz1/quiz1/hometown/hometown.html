                        Ponorogo Regency is a regency of East Java, Indonesia. It is considered the birthplace of Reog Ponorogo, a traditional Indonesian dance form.
                        According to the Babad Ponorogo history, Ponorogo was founded when Bathoro Katong conquered the Wengker region. This region had previously been controlled by Suryo Ngalam Wengker. Bathoro Katong originally settled in modern-day Pekalongan in what is now the village Setono in district Jenangan. Though faced with many obstacles, Raden Katong, Aji Selo, and Ki Ageng Mirah and his family continued to establish settlements in the region.<br>
                        <br>With the consent of all parties, Bathoro Katong established the Duchy Ponorogo on 11 August 1496. This date is celebrated as the founding of Ponorogo, and is corroborated by ancient objects, such as a pair of stone gilang located in front of the fifth gate of the Katong Batara tomb complex. The gilang contains the forms of a human meditating, trees, eagle and elephants (candrasengkala gilang memet); all of which combine to represent the Saka year 1496.

                        Ponorogo town, generally considered the birthplace of Reog, is also known by the names City (of) Reog and City (of) Rasta. Each year in the Islamic month of Muharram, Ponorogo holds a celebration known as Grebeg Suro, "the party of the people". Grebeg Suro involves many traditional events such as the National Reog Festival, the Heritage Carnival and the Larungan Proceedings of Prayer held at Lake Ngebel.<br>
                        <br>On 11 August, the anniversary of the founding of the Ponorogo Regency is celebrated. The day markes 11 August 1496, when Bathara Katong, the first leader of Ponorogo, went from the Old Town to the Central City of Ponorogo and crowned himself the first Duke of Ponorogo.<br>
                        <br>Ponorogo is also known for its culinary specialties such as Sate Ponorogo — grilled marinated chicken – served in peanut sauce, garnished with shredded shallots, chilli paste and lime juice.
