                        The thing that should not be missed when going to Ponorogo, of course, is watching the Reog show. In the past, Reog performances could only be seen during the Grebeg Suro event or the Reog Festival. However, that has changed. There is a Reog show which is regularly held every full moon night. Therefore, it is called the Full Moon Reog Performance.<br>
                        <br>To watch this show, tourists can directly come to the main stage area in Ponorogo Square. The show usually starts at 19.30 WIB. If the weather is not favorable, the performance will be moved to Paseban Alun-Alun Ponorogo. This show can be watched for free by the general public.
